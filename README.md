In this project, I applied convolutional neural networks to the binary classification problem of determining which of two classes ‘ normal’ or ‘pneumonia’ a chest x-ray falls under. The algorithm begins by transforming chest X-ray images into sizes smaller than the original. The next step involves the identification and classification of images by the convolutional neural network framework, which extracts features from the images and classifies them. I obtained a baseline model that achieved a 90% accuracy on the test set. 

The dataset is obtained from [www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) website.
